## Description

This is a complete visualization system for ioBroker.

It includes features like:

  - own simple scripting language
  - binding to ioBroker objects including converters & javascript expressions
  - paste of images from clipboard
  - drag drop of external images
  - drag drop of ioBroker objects to automaticy create bindings
  - drag drop of ioBroker objects to Properties to create Bindings to them
  - relative signal paths to ioBroker objects in screens (the full path can be hand over from outside to screen)
  - split view edit of html code
  - global stylesheet support
  - usage of npm packages containing webcomponents
  - screens inside of screens
  - use all icon packages from ioBroker
  - use charts from ioBroker
  - use combined signals object id's  e.g. "webui.0.test3.{webui.0.test3.select}" -> this will use the value from webui.0.test3.select for the signal name

## Installation

### Dependecies

  - You need the Web Adapter installed. It works with the following settings: ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.webui/master/web.png)
  
## Concepts

### Description

The Designer uses Webcomponents, so the HTML you Design is inside of a Shdowroot of a Webcomponent. This mens, you cannot style <body> or <html> inside of the Stylesheet. To style the outer Layout, use the ":host" selector.
This also means, you cannot use "on..." eventhandlers. Use the "@..." event assignment.

### Custom Controls in WebUI

You can create own reusable CustomControls in WebUI. This can have individual Javascript, Properties and a template.

You can use Double-Bracket Syntax and Double-Curly-Braket Syntax of "BaseCustomWebcomponent" to create bindings from the Template to the properties defined in the Designer. Curylbrackets create two way Bindings.
If you use the Bindings Dialog, you can Bind to a Property with ??Propertyname and to IoBroker Object in the Property via ?Propertyname.
In Scripts you can also write to Signals defined in Custom Properties.

You could also include Javascript in your CustomControl or Screen. Also you could use export a function "init(instance)" wich will be called when your CustomControl will be instanciated. (and also the connected and disconnected functions could be used)

## Sponsoring

If you want to help the development, sponsor this project at https://github.com/sponsors/jogibear9988

## Developing
  * Install Repository as Adapter in IOBroker
  * Download the Repository to an extra "dev" directory, do not develop inside the ioBroker Node_modules directory.
  * Do the following steps inside of the "dev" dirctory.

  * Install dependencies 
```
  $ npm install
```

  * Compile Typescript after doing changes (or press Ctrl + Shift + B in VsCode and select "tsc watch")
```
  $ npm run tsc
```

  * Adjust 'config.js' to match you ip-adress and port for your iobroker
   (The config.js in the repository root will be replaced with the one in '/config' when running 'npm build')
```
    window.iobrokerHost = '192.168.1.2';
    window.iobrokerPort = '8082';
    window.iobrokerSocketScriptUrl = 'http://' + window.iobrokerHost + ':' + window.iobrokerPort + '/lib/js/socket.io.js';
```

  * Run the app in a local server
```
  $ npm start
```

  * Navigate Chrome to [localhost:8000]() to see the app.

### More about Development

  - Run 
```
  $ npm run reflection
``` 
   to recreate reflection files for Scripting wich are used for the property grid

  - Run 
```
  $ npm run build
``` 
   to copy compiled files and node_modules to www folder so adapter is installable via github

  - Run 
```
  $ npm run release
  $ npm publish
``` 
   to create correct release commit for iobroker, Be carefull this also pushes to git repo.
   Be sure to edit "CHANGELOG.md" before, the text in "## **WORK IN PROGRESS**" in README.Md will be used for version info

## Info about the Adapter.

The Adapter is based on the following Designer component:
https://github.com/node-projects/web-component-designer

You need to create a screen "start", this is the first one called when you open runtime.html, 
but you can change this via query parameter:
runtime.html?screenName=screen2
